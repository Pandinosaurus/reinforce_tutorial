REINFORCE tutorial
=================

This repository contains a collection of scripts and notes that explain the basics of the so-called REINFORCE algorithm, a method for estimating the derivative of an expected value with respect to the parameters of the underlying sampling distribution.

The method was introduced into the reinforcement learning literature by Ronald J. Williams in ``Simple Statistical Gradient-Following Algorithms for Connectionist Reinforcement Learning'' (Machine Learning, 1992) but has earlier precedents.
